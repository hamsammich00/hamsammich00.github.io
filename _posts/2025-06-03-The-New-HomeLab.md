# The "New" Host
So, I found a few parts of my old PC have created my own Proxmox host! I am something of an AMD fan when it comes to hardware as their consumer space and now even their server grade hardware are getting really good performance. 

# Specs
I perform my pc upgrades like the ship of Theseus. If I change out 1 component of my PC at a time, when does it cease to be the same PC that I started with? Either way, after a period of time and many upgrades I eventually have another computer worth of parts lying arounf. This is an amalgamation of that.  
  
CPU: Ryzen 1600 (6 core 12 thread)  
Motherboard: Asrock X370  
RAM: 16GB of G Skill 3200   
GPU: RX 470 8gb  
Storage: 256gb Kingston SSD   
  
So the specs of the host arent very impressive but they are workable for the time being. Will edit with a photo later. 

# Networking
Freshly installed in tandem with my ISP's modem is my new Gl.iNet Flint 2 router. It is a great OpenWRT based router with, so far, an awesome and simple UI to set up my static IPs, the built in AddGuard Home, and port forward for any projects that require it.
