# The "New" Host
So, I found a few parts of my old PC have created my own Proxmox host! I am something of an AMD fan when it comes to hardware as their consumer space and now even their server grade hardware are getting really good performance. 

# Specs
My "first" pc was a Bulldozer Architere FX8120 that I overclocked to 4GHz all core. This was pretty much my "version 2" of that as I am on "version 3" of my desktop because I perform my pc upgrades like the ship of Theseus. If I change out 1 component of my PC at a time, when does it cease to be the same PC that I started with?
  
So the specs of the host arent very impressive but they are workable for the time being. Will edit with a photo later.  
  
CPU: Ryzen 1600 (6 core 12 thread)  
Motherboard: Asrock X370  
RAM: 16GB of G Skill 3200   
GPU: RX 470 8gb (the RX 400 and 500 series were similar, the 70, 80, and 90 8gb were basically the same but with clocks and voltages cut back)  
Storage: 256gb Kingston SSD   
  
This is a workable host for the time being. 

# Networking
Freshly installed in tandem with my ISP's modem is my new Gl.iNet Flint 2 router. It is a great OpenWRT based router with a, so far, awesome and simple UI I can access from my PC so i can set up my static IPs, the built in AddGuard Home, and port foreward for any projects that require it.
