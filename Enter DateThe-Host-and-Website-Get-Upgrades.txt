# The New Website
After some thought, I decided to rebrand a little and purchase a [domain](https://landonslab.com). It is most likely what you're on now. This is going
to allow for this site to seem a bit more professional, allow for me to gain exposure to domain management, and public facing DNS with the website.

# Host Upgrades
The Proxmox host I built has been very serviceable up until a point. While you can over provision CPU, you cannot do so with RAM and, to a certain extent, storage.
 I very quickly became RAM and storage limited. In order to avoid drops in uptime, I upgraded the RAM to 32GB and added 2x500gb HDDs for bulk storage/storing
  VMs that are not needing heavy read/write.

# The Domain Controller
In order to be able to test the most common enterprise OS, Windows, I have created a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller to allow ID management at scale. 
I have even joined my Linux based VMs with Realm. In order to achieve this, I had to adjust the DNS server my Linux VMs were point to to become the DC I 
built on a dedicated IP outside of the DHCP range of my other VMs. Using the new tools available, I was able to create 2 accounts, one Daily Driver, and one Admin account. This will help simulate the processes used by both sides 
of administration.
