# The "New" Host
So, I finally got around to turning my old PC parts into have my own Proxmox host! I am something of an AMD fan which will become apparent in time.  

# Specs
I perform my pc upgrades like the ship of Theseus. If I change out 1 component of my PC at a time, when does it cease to be the same PC that I started with? Either way, after a period of time and many upgrades I eventually have another computer worth of parts lying around. This is an amalgamation of that.  
  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 1600 (6 core 12 thread)  
Motherboard: Asrock X370  
RAM: 16GB of G Skill 3200   
GPU: AMD RX 470 8gb  
Storage: 256gb Kingston SSD   
  
So the specs of the host arent very impressive but they are workable for the time being. the GPU is just in case if i need GPU passthrough for a project but is a weak link in this chain for sure. Will edit with a photo later.

# Networking
Freshly installed in tandem with my ISP's modem is my new Gl.iNet Flint 2 router. It is a great OpenWRT based router with an awesomely simple UI to set up my static IPs, the built in AddGuard Home, and port forward for any projects that require it.  

# The Future 
Well, I am unsure where I want to go from here. If budget was no option, I would pick up a server tower and build a big AMD Epyc CPU setup but I don't have a need for that much horsepower. Yet. I do need more storage for certain. That will be picked up in time. More RAM is certainly something that would help. Honestly, Having some trouble figuring out what exactly I want to do with this, what i wish to create. I do plan on making a Minecraft server as a proof of concept for myself to become accustomed to more networking, especially with the process of making  reverse proxy for it.
