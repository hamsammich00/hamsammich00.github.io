# The New Website
After some thought, I decided to rebrand a little and purchase a [domain](https://landonslab.com). It is most likely what you're on now.

# Host Upgrades
The Proxmox host I built has been very serviceable up until a point. I very quickly became RAM limited. I found a pack of 2x16gb DDR4 laying around that is a great replacement for the 4x4gb set I had in before. I also ended up finding 500gb disk drives to hopefully give some space for additional drives to be added to the VMs or to host a large VM by itself. It being a HDD can cause some speed issues versus an SSD if there is too much trying to read/write at once.

# The Domain Controller
I finally downloaded a Windows Server 2022 ISO and created 2 VMs from it: a DC with Windows Core and another "toolbox/general purpose" server to test scripts not on my local machine. This development will allow faster times for account proliferation on both Linux and Windows VMs. I have already begun domain joining my VMs and turning off ones I don't use.
