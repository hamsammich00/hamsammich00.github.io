# News Regarding the Site and Other Updates

It has been a bit since I have posted, mainly busy with other things at the moment. I have not forgotten about this place though. I have created a [new Demo-Scripts repo](https://github.com/hamsammich00/Demo-Scripts-Repo) to house random little creations I make that don't warrant a whole post on them. I hope to flesh it out more in time. 

In other news, I found out ways to spruce up the Github profile. I added and about me section with some animated text, I just wanted to play with it some, may use it here in spots for more "pop".
